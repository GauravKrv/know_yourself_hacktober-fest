For me both are important. I mean i cannot go only for money if i am not happy from the job I am doing to earn it, at the same time if i am not getting paid enough for the work I am doing, I'll not be happy either. So what matters for me is happiness, if i love the job and am getting paid enough then its good

Both are important for a healthy life. If you are not enjoying the work you are doing and getting enough paid then it is not good for your mental health because you are not enjoying what you are doing and also if you are enjoying the work you are doing but not gwtting paid enough then it may break your motivation but if you are giving your evrything to your work then one day you will get the result for sure.
