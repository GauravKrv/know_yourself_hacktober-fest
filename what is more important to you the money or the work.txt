What is more important to you: the money or the work?

For me both are important. I mean i cannot go only for money if i am not happy from the job I am doing to earn it, at the same time if i am not getting paid enough for the work I am doing, I'll not be happy either. So what matters for me is happiness, if i love the job and am getting paid enough then its good
