What does success mean to you?

Success means living a healthy and happy life with our loved ones.Success is when i can give everything to my family and my partner. Success is when we can live our life where we dont have to overthink before buying any necessary things or to some extent spending luxurious life with our family. It also means we get enough time for our life and we should  not only be busy in work.
