Would you like to work overtime or odd hours?

working in overtime depends on the situation, if i am in need of some money then i can work overtime for my job. But if it isn't so than i would like to work for myself, for my dream and my passion. i would like to do some creative things in my free time which makes me happy, wether it is related to job or not. But yes, I would like to give my time for my development may it be in an field.
