 #mrxdripp
 My name is Dripp and i am X years old. I started my CS background from exploring various fields in it, first I got to learn about the security and threats in our internet world, then i took some good knowledge on Android, did some projects and hackathons and contributed to some, then in the desire of learning more I learnt backend and web so I could know how things work in the server side, I have also explored ML and Software testing fields. Now basically am comfortable with X, Y and Z stack with all the prior knowledge in various fields. <NO AC YT>
Now I am looking to leverage everything I've learned and get some hands-on-work experience.
